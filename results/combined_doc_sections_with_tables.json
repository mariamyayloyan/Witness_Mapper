        "text": "2. Respondent, Equatoriana RenPower Ltd. (ERenPow) is a fully government-owned company.\n3.\nIt was created in 2004 by a merger of the two state-owned energy companies operating in the\nfield of renewables. In addition to being a major player in the Equatorianian market with its\nwind and solar farms, ERenPow plays an important role in the “Green Energy Strategy” of the\nGovernment of Equatoriana. To ensure the ambitious goal of Net-Zero-2040, ERenPow was\nto invest in the creation of a “sustainable hydrogen infrastructure covering the entire value chain\nneeded to decarbonize Equatoriana's large steel and transport industry”, as was stated in the\nGreen Energy Strategy. On 3 January 2023, ERenPow invited bids for the construction and\ndelivery of a plant to produce green hydrogen and potential derivatives.\nThe relevant documents were published via the official tender platform. They provided that the\ntender process as such was governed by the Public Procurement Law of Equatoriana and be\nconducted in its initial phase as a reverse auction. It was a technology open tender, and for the\ncomparability of the various proposals, the overall efficiency in relation to the price was\nrelevant. The Request for Quotation further stated that the local content of the materials to be\nprovided was an important factor in evaluating the bids and to be eligible a minimum of 25%\nwas required. (Claimant Exhibit C 1).\n4. According to the description, the bids were to cover the following four elements: a fixed 100\nMW plant for the production of green hydrogen (turnkey), maintenance and training services\nfor one year, and two options for Respondent concerning the extension of the plant. The first\ncovered a mere extension in capacity up to double the fixed contracted capacity. The second\ncovered the addition of a part for the production of eAmmonia.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\nFor Claimant, the realisation of the project was of considerable importance. It would have been\nthe first opportunity for Claimant to showcase its new technology on a larger scale and show\nthe advantages of its patent-protected production process. The process allows for the use of\nthe excess heat created during the production of hydrogen for district heating, thereby\nincreasing the overall efficiency of the plant. So far, the only operating plant is Claimant's own\n5 MW facility and at the time of the tender, another 20 MW plant had just been commissioned\nby the Government of Mediterraneo. Claimant's innovative process is based on electrolysis\nusing a proton exchange membrane (PEM-electrolysis). It relies on the special properties of the\nused membrane, which is permeable to protons but not to gases such as hydrogen or oxygen.\nThe relevant electrolysers are delivered in stacks of 10 MW each. The modular setup has the\nadvantage that further stacks may be added at a later time, provided that the required other\ninfrastructure and space is available.\nThe PEM-electrolysis is particularly suitable for the use of unstable renewable power, and the\noverall plant efficiency in Claimant's research facility was over 85% due to the additional use of\nthe process heat.\nThe great attraction of the project was the likelihood that it could be realized within a very short\ntime. There was strong Equatorianian government support, and many preparatory steps in the\nplanning and permission process had already been taken. Under the Green Energy Strategy, the\nnecessary environmental, construction, and operation permits for green energy projects were\nto be granted in a facilitated and expedited procedure, which included strict timelines and a\nlimitation of the possible objections. For the project itself, those parts of the planning process\ninvolving the participation of the local communities had already been completed, excluding the\nrisk of any delay from that side. The issuance of the necessary environmental permits was\nimminent and only depended on internal procedures. For the other permits, which usually do\nnot create any problems, the detailed planning of the plant was necessary. Furthermore, the\nconstruction site was prepared and well-connected with the required infrastructure.\nIn addition, a suitable transformer was available. In 2020, Claimant ordered the transformer\nfrom its long-time Equatorianian business partner Volta Transformer for another project. The\ntransformer was to be delivered in early 2024, but in November 2022 the other project had\nbeen cancelled due to the insolvency of the other customer. The transformer was of the right\nsize for the present project with a capacity able to cover also the two options, should\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

        "text": "9.\nRespondent make use of them. The availability of the suitable transformer meant that one of\nthe obstacles of projects as the one at hand which often resulted in longer lead in times could\nbe avoided.\nIn light of these two factors, it was realistic that the plant would start producing green hydrogen\nfrom the beginning of 2026 onwards, as planned in the Request for Quotation, if the contracts\nwere concluded in summer 2023. The fact that the plant would be operative by 2026 was\nimportant for the Claimant and an attraction of the project since it would allow the Claimant\nto use the project as a reference project for potential new projects, i.e., new customers. Taking\ninto account the exponential market growth predicted from 2026 onwards, the existence of\nsuch a reference project was extremely important for Claimant. It could have helped to disprove\nthe reservations which existed in certain quarters of the renewable energy community against\nthe PEM-technique. While it is generally recognized that the PEM-technique has many\nadvantages, in particular in case of an unstable power supply by green energy, its economic\nviability has been questioned by interested competitors. In light of these opportunities\nassociated with a successful bid, Claimant decided to enter the tender process with an initial\noffer which was calculated on a cost-only basis without any profit margin.\n10. On the basis of its initial offer and the innovative technology, Claimant was amongst the two\nfinal bidders with whom ERenPow entered into specific negotiations from early May 2023\nonwards. From the beginning of the tender process, Claimant had been exploring its\nopportunities to fulfil its obligations of local content both in relation to the already fixed part\nof the delivery obligations as well as for the two options. At the time the detailed negotiations\nstarted, Claimant had been in very promising negotiations with two local producers. If\nsuccessful, these negotiations would have ensured local content going well beyond the required\n25%, in particular in case the eAmmonia-option was exercised.\n11. For the hydrogen plant itself, i.e. the agreed 100 MW plant and the extension option, Claimant\nwas about to sign a contract with Volta Transformer. According to the contract, Volta\nTransformer was not only to provide the transformer for the project but also 40% of the\nelectrolyser stacks as well as the packaging of all stacks at the site in Greenfield in Equatoriana.\nThe non-transformer-related tasks were to be performed by Volta Electrolyser, a 100%\nsubsidiary of Volta Transformer. Volta Electrolyser produced, under a licence from Claimant,\nelectrolysers which were nearly identical to the ones of Claimant's and could thus be combined\neasily with Claimant's stacks. That contract had largely been negotiated by the end of June 2023\nbut was finally signed only on 25 August 2023. The delay in signing was due to an unexpected\noffer on 29 June by the Volta Family, the owner of Volta Transformer, to sell the latter to\nClaimant. After an agreement had been reached on how the contract for the Green Hydrogen\nPlant should affect the purchase price for Volta Transformer, it was finally signed on 25 August\n2023. The overall value of the contract for the fixed part of the Green Hydrogen Plant was\nclose to EUR 100 million, while for the extension option, the plan was to reduce the quantity\nof stacks to be delivered by Volta Transformer to 20% and let them do the entire packaging.\n12. In addition, since May 2023 Claimant has been in promising negotiations with the\nEquatorianian company P2G for the eAmmonia-option. At the time, Claimant was concerned\nthat it would not have the necessary expertise, experience, and manpower to plan and build the\neAmmonia module itself within the ambitious time frame. Thus, the plan was to largely contract\nout that work to a company with more experience in the field and limit Claimant's involvement\nto the overall planning and the integration of the module into the hydrogen plant. In that case,\nClaimant itself would have provided merely works and services making up roughly 20% of the\nvalue of the eAmmonia option while the remaining 80% would have been provided by P2G. If\neverything had worked out as planned and Respondent had made use only of the eAmmonia-\noption, around 45% of the overall contract volume would have been produced and delivered\nby entities from Equatoriana.\n13. During the final discussion between the two CEOs on 13 July 2023, Claimant informed\nRespondent that it was willing to lower its already competitive price by another 5%, in return\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

On the basis of the calculation\nat the time, the offer would not only have failed to cover the costs but also resulted in a loss of\nEUR 15 million already for the fixed part if no further savings could be realized. Respondent\nwas aware of that, as Claimant was very transparent about its cost calculation during the\nnegotiations. The realization of that innovative project required ongoing and forward-looking\ncooperation between the two partners who trust each other. Claimant also informed\nRespondent about its ongoing negotiations with the two local partners and the possibility that,\nif successful, Claimant would have a local content of much more than the required 25%.\n14. After two and a half months of intensive negotiations, Claimant finally managed to sign the\nPurchase and Service Agreement with Respondent on 17 July 2023. Deviating slightly from the\noriginally planned structure, the Agreement provided in essence that Claimant would deliver at\na first stage a plant of 100 MW at a price of EUR 285 million and would grant Respondent two\noptions for the extension of the plant in capacity and products (Claimant Exhibit C 2).\n15. As agreed, there was considerable media coverage about the project and the signing of the\ncontract. The media emphasized the innovative character of the technology used (Claimant\nExhibit C 3). Unfortunately, someone also leaked incorrect information about Claimant's\nadherence to the local content requirement, which seriously affected its ongoing negotiation\nwith the local partner P2G for the eAmmonia module, reinforcing unrealistic price\nexpectations.\n16. In the end, the negotiations with P2G failed due to quality issues, and Claimant had to contract\nGreen Ammonia from Danubia as its partner for the eAmmonia module. This had no influence\non the local content for the contracted 100 MW green hydrogen plant which was still above the\nrequested 25% but would have resulted in a lower percentage if Respondent exercised the\neAmmonia option. Claimant immediately informed Respondent that its plan to contract P2G\nfor the eAmmonia module had not worked (Claimant Exhibit C 4).\n17. In October 2023, local elections in Equatoriana led to a shift in the power balance within the\nEquatorianian government. As a consequence, Mr. Positive, the particularly unpopular minister\nfor energy and environment, was replaced by a colleague from the Equatoriana National Party\n(ENP), Ms. Theresa Vent. The ENP and Ms. Vent had long opposed the Green Energy Strategy\ndeveloped by the previous minister. In their view, it was too strict and too focused on specific\nquotas for certain types of renewables, in particular green hydrogen.\n18. In her first press conference, Ms. Vent announced a revision of the Green Energy Strategy and\na major reshuffle in the board of directors of ERenPow. On 27 December 2023, Claimant's\nCEO, Mr. Cavendish, received a call from his then counterpart at ERenPow, Ms. Michelle\nFaraday. Ms. Faraday informed Mr. Cavendish that she would be replaced by the end of the\nmonth by a former manager of a solar company, Mr. Henry la Cour. He was a member of the\nENP and a well-known critic of hydro energy. She confirmed rumours that ERenPow would\nreview all contracts to see whether they fit the new policy objectives (Claimant Exhibit C 5).\nHer prediction was that the new CEO would try everything to either terminate the unwanted\ncontracts or at least aggressively renegotiate them.\n19. That is what happened shortly thereafter. On 29 February 2024, Respondent gave notice of\ntermination of the Purchase and Service Agreement due to a delay of 28 days in delivering the\nfinal plans for the entire plant including the options (Claimant Exhibit C 6). Mr. la Cour further\npointed to a provision in the law of Equatoriana according to which state entities could always\nterminate contracts for convenience against the payment of expenses incurred if government\npolicies changed. In the ensuing negotiations, Respondent took the position that the Agreement\nallegedly no longer fitted the amended policy and thus had to be terminated.\n20. Claimant strongly contested that view, and Mr. Cavendish left no doubt that in its view\nRespondent had no right to terminate the Agreement. In light of Claimant's interest in the\nrealisation of the project as a reference project, any right to terminate for convenience had been\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

During the Parties' negotiations, Claimant very soon got the impression that the termination\nwas primarily intended to reduce the already very favourable price even further. Respondent's\nhigher management always played with the option of fulfilling the contract under certain\nconditions that would lead to a more favourable price for Respondent. At the final stage of the\nnegotiations, Respondent purported to have received the green light from the new minister to\ncontinue with the project provided that Claimant accepts another price reduction of 15%. This\nis evident from the content of the without-prejudice offer made by Respondent in the\nnegotiations. (Claimant Exhibit C 7).\n22. The offer shows that Claimant, whilst pretending not to pursue the Green Hydrogen Project\ndue to a change in policy, was actually merely interested in renegotiating the price. This is not a\nvalid reason for terminating the Purchase and Service Agreement with Claimant.\nLEGAL EVALUATION\n23. The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction and the claim is admissible.\n24. According to the dispute resolution clause in Art. 30 of the Agreement, the Arbitration shall be\nconducted in English under the FAI-Rules, with the place of arbitration in Vindobona,\nDanubia. The relevant clause provides:\n\"Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach,\ntermination or validity thereof, shall first be submitted to mediation in accordance with the\nMediation Rules of the Finland Chamber of Commerce.\n(a) The place of mediation shall be Danubia.\n(b) The language of the mediation shall be English.\nAny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach,\ntermination or validity thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the\nRules for Expedited Arbitration of the Finland Chamber of Commerce. However, at the\nrequest of a party, the Arbitration Institute of the Finland Chamber of Commerce may\ndetermine that the Arbitration Rules of the Finland Chamber of Commerce shall apply\ninstead of the Rules for Expedited Arbitration if the Arbitration Institute considers this to\nbe appropriate considering the amount in dispute, the complexity of the case, and other\nrelevant circumstances.\n(a) The seat of arbitration shall be in Vindobona, Danubia.\n(b) The language of the arbitration shall be English.”\n25. Neither the jurisdiction nor the admissibility of the claim is affected by the fact that the Parties\ndid not enter into mediation proceedings as foreseen in the first part of Art. 30. From the\nconduct of the Parties' negotiations and Respondent's final offer of 25 May 2024, it was obvious\nthat mediation would not have resulted in a resolution of the dispute, given Respondent's\ninsistence on a 15% price reduction. In its without-prejudice offer following a meeting of both\nCEOs a week earlier, Respondent had made clear that “any further discussion made only sense\nif Claimant was willing to talk about serious price reduction of 15% or at least a two-digit\nnumber\" (Claimant Exhibit C 7). That was, however, obviously unacceptable for Claimant,\nwhich was already making a deficit under the contract as it stood. Thus, mediation would have\nbeen a mere waste of time and resources.\n26. The Agreement is governed by the CISG. The choice of law clause in Art. 29 of the Agreement\nprovides:\n\"The Agreement is governed by the law of Equatoriana to the exclusion of its conflict of\nlaws principles\".\n27. As Equatoriana is a Contracting State of the CISG, the CISG applies to the Agreement, which\nis an international sales transaction.

As a mixed contract containing engineering and planning work as well as the delivery of goods,\nthe Agreement also falls within the sphere of application of the CISG. The preponderant part\nwith a value of over 60% of the overall prices consists of the delivery of goods.\n29. Respondent's purported termination is invalid, as it is neither justified under the Agreement\nnor under the CISG. During the final stage of the negotiations, the Parties explicitly agreed that\nin return for a further reduction of the initially proposed price of 5% by Claimant, Respondent\nwould only have a right to terminate the Agreement in case of severe breaches and would use\nits best endeavors to make the project a success. Thus, any right of termination for convenience\nwas excluded as explicitly discussed between the Parties.\n30. The delay in the first delivery did not constitute a fundamental breach justifying a termination\nof the Agreement under the CISG. Respondent only used the delay in the first delivery as a\npretext to terminate the contract. In fact, it is the change in the Equatorianian government and\nthe new government's change in policy that was driving Respondent's decision to terminate the\ncontract. Moreover, it is Respondent that had promised to use its best endeavors to ensure the\nsuccess of the project. This obligation of Respondent had been introduced in the contract under\nthe condition that Claimant accepted the low price and was able to use the plant as a showcase.\nBy terminating the contract for no valid reason, Respondent breached its promise to use its\nbest efforts for the project implementation.\n31. As a consequence, Claimant is entitled here to ask for specific performance of the contract, i.e.,\nthat Respondent continues to fulfill the contract, accepts delivery, and pays for it.\n32. The estimated monetary value of the claim in the sense of Article 6.3 (f) FAI-Rules is EUR 100\nmillion, representing Claimant's interest in the performance of the Agreement as planned. In\nlight of the amount in dispute and the complexity of the case, Claimant considers the application\nof the Arbitration Rules of the Finland Chamber of Commerce (Arbitration Rules) to be more\nappropriate and suggests that, deviating from Article 19.1 (d) of the Arbitration Rules, the third\narbitrator should be appointed directly by the Arbitration Institute.\n33.

        "text": "In the presence of James Positive,\nEquatoriana's Minister for Energy and\nEnvironment, Equatoriana RenPower (ERP)\nand Green Hydrogen yesterday signed an\nagreement for the construction of one of\nthe most advanced green hydrogen plants\nwith an original capacity of 100 MW, but the\npossibility to increase the output at a later\ntime up to double the amount. According to\nMs. Faraday, the Agreement has the\npotential to be a quantum leap in the\nproduction of green hydrogen ensuring\nEquatoriana's position as one of the leading\nnations in the production of green energy.\nThe Agreement was the result of a\ncontroversial tender process which started\nin January 2023. With the publication of the\nGreen Energy Strategy there has been, what\ncritics have called, a \"hydro-hype”. The\nnumber of start-ups in the fields has\nmultiplied as has the investment. Still there\nis, however, no production of green\nhydrogen on a large-scale basis, in particular\nnot on the basis of PEM-electrolysis, used by\nGreen Hydrogen. While it is generally\nacknowledged that PEM-electrolysis is\nconceptually more suitable for the use of an\nunsteady supply of energy resulting from\nrenewables, its proponents have yet to\nprove the commercial viability of the\ntechnique. It is considerably more expensive\nthan the traditional alkaline electrolysis and\nit has not yet been shown that the higher\ncosts are compensated by the higher\nefficiency. Green Hydrogen's CEO Mr.\nCavendish told journalists that he was happy\nto finally prove to critics that their concerns\nlacked any basis. In his view, Equatoriana\nRenPower was the perfect partner to show\nthat the technique could not only be\noperated at small scale but also in large\nplants of 100 MW or more. With the strong\ngovernment support and the advanced\nstage of planning, he considered the plan to\nhave the plant operating from 2026\nambitious but realistic.\nWhile for most other bidders the long lead\ntimes for transformers made the deadline\nunrealistic, Green Hydrogen had apparently\nguaranteed during the negotiations to have\nCLAIMANT EXHIBIT C 3\na transformer of the correct size available\nfrom the beginning of 2024. It is very likely\nthat this is the transformer which had\noriginally been ordered from Volta\nTransformer for the abandoned project in\nRuritania. Volta Transformer, a world\nmarket leader in the area of large\ntransformers based in Equatoriana and\nbelonging to the Volta family refused to\ncomment on that.\nNot everyone is convinced about the\ndecision of ERP. The criticism is coming\nfrom different angles and circles. Some\nquestion whether energy production with\ngreen hydrogen is really efficient. Others\nquestioned the decision to supplement the\nplant with production facilities for e-\nAmmonia. In their view facilities for the\nproduction of e-fuels would have been\nneeded more urgently.\nInformed circles report that a crucial\nelement for awarding the project to Green\nHydrogen was the amount of parts\nproduced locally in Equatoriana. Apparently\nGreen Hydrogen is in advanced talks with\ntwo local companies. They would supply of\nclose to 50% of the parts and services\nneeded to fulfill the contract in the likely\nevent that ERP realizes the e-Ammonia\noption. It seems, that Green Hydrogen's\nprimary expertise lies in the field of\nhydrogen production while it has to rely on\noutside know-how for the production of e-\nAmmonia.\nIt can be assumed that the Agreement had\nthe political backing of Mr. Positive. Thus,\nthe minister, as usual goes all in. It is unlikely\nthat he would politically survive a failure of\nthe project. After some controversial\nlegislative projects and the massive\ncampaign started by the opposition and\nparts of the ENP against his politics his\nsupport rates are at an all time low. That\nmakes him the premier candidate for any\ngovernment restructuring.\nIt remains to be seen whether the project\ndevelops into the great success predicted\nby its proponents or is actually the\nboondoggle foreseen by the critics.\nTRANSITION NEWS\n18 July 2023\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

I would like to keep you updated on our negotiations with Volta\nTransformer and with P2G.\nThe contract with Volta Transformer was finally signed yesterday with the content which had\nformed the basis for the guaranteed part of local content in our Agreement. Consequently, Volta\nTransformer, either directly or through its subsidiary Volta Electrolysers, will provide 40% of the\nelectrolyser stacks, the transformer and related electronic equipment, as well as perform the\npacking of all stacks at the Greenfield site in Equatoriana.\nUnfortunately, the negotiations with P2G for their contribution to the optional eAmmonia module\nfailed in the end. Our visits to their production site raised doubts that P2G would be able to\nprovide the contracted services and work products within the time agreed. We are also concerned\nthat their eAmmonia production installation would not meet our quality standards and thus would\nnot fit well into our plant. We have scrutinized their production process, as well as their workforce\nfor the last three weeks, and realized that it is doubtful that they can guarantee the quality and\nefficiency required.\nThe good news is, however, that Green Ammonia, the second company we were investigating as a\npotential supplier, complied with the quality requirements. They have also sufficient capacity to\ndeliver the required products and services within a short period of time. At present their sole\nproduction facility is based in Danubia. Should our orders increase in the future, they will have to\nbuild a second production facility. In that case, the most natural place for them would be\nEquatoriana, where they would then have a reference project.\nIrrespective of whether the option is finally exercised, we easily meet the local content requirement\nconcerning the material to be provided. Even if you look at both parts of the Agreement, i.e., the\nElectrolyser-part and the EPC-part, for the firmly contracted capacity of 100 MW, the material\nproduced and delivered by Volta Transformer makes up more than 30% of it. If you are just looking\nat the materials physically delivered, i.e., leaving out the planning, engineering, and construction\nwork provided by us, the products delivered by Volta Transformer amount to more than 40% of\nthe products delivered.\nI will keep you updated on all further developments.\nKind regards,\nPoul\nCEO\nGreenHydro plc\n1974 Russell Avenue, Capital City\nMediterraneo\nT: (0)146 9346355\nEmail: p.cavendish@greenhydro.me\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

        "text": "CLAIMANT EXHIBIT C 5\nWitness Statement Poul Cavendish\n1. I am 57 years old and have been the CEO of GreenHydro since 2019.\n2. I have a BS and a Master's degree in Engineering Science.\n3. After my studies, I worked for several companies in the field of renewable energy production in\nand outside of Mediterraneo. In 2012, I became the head of research at Claimant, and in 2019\nits CEO.\n4. Claimant is a medium-sized engineering company with more than 2,000 employees active in the\narea of renewable energy production. After years of research, Claimant has developed an\ninnovative process for the production of hydrogen for industrial use. It relied on PEM-\nelectrolysis and recovered the heat created during the electrolysis for use in distant heating.\n5. We have always been interested in the market in Equatoriana. After the announcement of its\nambitious Green Energy Strategy in 2019, Equatoriana has been one of the fastest-growing\nmarkets for producing renewable energy, in particular green hydrogen. One of the main drivers\nin the market was Equatoriana RenPower, the government-owned producer of green energy.\nWith its wind farms and solar parks, it played an important role in Equatoriana's Green Energy\nStrategy. In particular, it was tasked to develop the green hydrogen infrastructure necessary for\nattaining the ambitious Net-Zero 2040 goal of the Green Energy Strategy. I was pleased to\nrealize that the then-CEO of Equatoriana RenPower was a former classmate from my master's\nprogram, Dr. Michelle Faraday.\n6. When it became clear in 2022 that Equatoriana RenPower was planning to build three larger\nplants for the production of green hydrogen, we applied to be listed as one of the potential\nsellers. We were approved in November 2022, and on 3 January 2023, Equatoriana RenPower\ninvited us to participate in a tender of its first major production facility for green hydrogen in\nEquatoriana.\n7. For us, the delivery and construction of the plant would have been a unique opportunity to\nshowcase our new technology of green hydrogen production at a larger scale. Due to its\nambitious Green Energy Strategy, Equatoriana was moving much faster with environmental,\nconstruction, and operation permits for such projects. The investment climate was very\nfavorable and we estimated for the future an exponential growth of the market for green\nhydrogen both in Equatoriana and elsewhere. Thus, the very ambitious timeline for the project,\nwhich foresaw a start of production at the beginning of 2026, made the project extremely\nattractive for us, as it provided the opportunity of a reference project in the near future.\n8. In fact, the strict and ambitious timeline for the project, which prevented other companies from\nparticipating in the tender was in our favor. At the time of contracting, there was a considerable\nlead time of close to three years for the necessary transformers. That made the realization of the\nproject within 2.5 years largely impossible for all companies which neither had a suitable\ntransformer in their portfolio nor had at least ordered one before the tender process started. We\nwere fortunate to have a transformer readily available for the plant. In 2020, we had ordered\nfrom Volta Transformer for another project in Ruritania a transformer with a capacity of up to\n400 MW. In November 2022, our customer in Ruritania filed for bankruptcy and the other\nproject was stopped by the insolvency administrator. As a consequence, however, we had a\ntransformer for the present project from 2024 onwards for which only a few modifications were\nrequired.\n9. In light of the visibility of the project and the unique opportunity to build a reference plant, we\ndecided right away to submit a bid with a specifically low price that merely covered our direct\nand indirect costs and, thus, included no profit. Our initial bid provided for the delivery of the\nturnkey 100 MW plant including one year of maintenance for a price of EUR 300 million. The\neAmmonia-option would have costed EUR 100 million and the (full) extension option would\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

On the basis of this bid, we\nwere then selected by Equatoriana RenPower as one of the two final bidders with whom they\nentered into detailed negotiations.\n10. These detailed negotiations were facilitated by the fact that I knew Dr. Faraday very well from\nmy master's program and we both have comparable views about climate change and the crucial\nrole of hydrogen in the energy transition. Thus, when the main negotiators, Mr. Deiman on our\nside and Ms. Ritter on Respondent's side, seemed to have hit an impasse at the final stage of the\nnegotiations, I called Dr. Faraday and agreed to have a meeting with her to remove the final\nhurdles. During those final discussions on 13 July 2023, I was very frank about our economic\ninterest in the plant and our willingness to actually offer the plant at a cost price or even slightly\nbelow in return for the ability to use it as a showcase for our new technology. In the end, we\nagreed to reduce the already very favorable purchase price by another 5% in return for a waiver\nof Equatoriana RenPower's right to terminate the contract for convenience at any time against\nthe payment of damages. We also agreed on a best endeavors clause concerning the ongoing\nmutual support for the successful realization of the project. As Ms. Faraday also had a strong\ninterest in the success of the project, she did not have any problems with consenting to the\nchanges requested. That was even more so as she knew that we were trying our best to overfulfill\nthe local content quota.\n11. To meet the local content requirements and increase our chance of winning the tender, we\ndecided to not only use the transformer from Volta Transformer but also to purchase 40% of\nthe electrolyser stacks from them. Volta Transformer's 100% subsidiary, Volta Electrolyser, was\nproducing PEM-electrolysers under our licence which were largely identical to our electrolysers\nand could therefore be easily combined with them.

We therefore decided to go with Green Ammonia.\n13. At the end of 2023, the economic downturn and local elections in Equatoriana led to a shift in\nthe power balance of the government. As a consequence, the very unpopular minister of energy\nand environment, Mr. Positive, who had been the “father” of the Green Energy Strategy, was\nreplaced by Ms. Theresa Vent. Ms. Vent was from the political party ENP. She had been an\noutspoken opponent of the Green Energy Strategy and in particular its strong quota for\nhydrogen. Thus, one of her first steps was to order a revision of the strategy and to replace Dr.\nFaraday as the CEO of Equatoriana RenPower.\n14. On 27 December 2023, Dr. Faraday called me to inform me about her replacement as CEO.\nDuring that call, she confirmed rumors in the market that Equatoriana RenPower would review\nall existing contracts in light of the change in strategy, in particular those for the three hydrogen\nprojects including ours. The new CEO, Mr. Henry la Cour, had earlier worked in the wind\nindustry where he had developed the reputation of being a tough negotiator and a disruptive\nforce.\n15. In early May 2024, I arranged for a personal meeting with Mr. la Cour, hoping that we might\nsolve the existing problems in a personal discussion. The meeting was, however, very brief. Mr.\nla Cour immediately made clear that further support from the government, in particular from\nthe new minister Ms. Vent, was necessary. Such support would require a significant deduction\nof the price agreed in the Agreement; otherwise, the minister would not authorize the\ncontinuation of the Agreement. The meeting with Mr. la Cour ended quickly as there was\napparently no room for any further discussions. This was then confirmed in Respondent's\nwithout-prejudice offer of 25 May 2024.\n16. The offer, furthermore, made abundantly clear that without a serious price reduction of at least\na double-digit number, any further negotiations would be fruitless. Since we could not agree to\nsuch a reduction, we saw no point in starting obviously hopeless mediation. To lose as little time\nas possible, we directly initiated arbitration.\n17.

Your belated delivery of the\ndetailed plans for the plant, 28 days after the agreed milestone on 1 February 2024, and still lacking\nplans for the eAmmonia module, constitutes such a breach and raises serious concerns about your\nability to perform the Agreement as contractually agreed.\nIn addition, as a governmental entity, Equatoriana RenPower is entitled to terminate any of its\ncontracts for convenience if it conflicts with the policies of the government. As you are probably\naware from the public discussion, there have been serious concerns about the negative effects of\nthe Green Energy Strategy on the competitiveness of Equatorianian businesses due to the high\ncosts of energy. That has led to a revision of the strategy which no longer focuses on the\nexpensive generation of energy using hydrogen but more on other less expensive sources of\nenergy. Consequently, the contract concluded with you no longer fits into Equatoriana's energy\nstrategy.\nCould I ask you to confirm receipt of this letter and inform us about your availability to discuss\nthe legal consequences and the details of the termination?

While we are still in the process of feasibility studies, it is already clear that to be\ncompetitive the price for the plant including the two extension options would have to be at\nleast 15% lower.\nIn the interest of keeping the good relationship with you and ensuring the jobs of the\nEquatorianian workers at Volta Transformer, we would like to make the following offer without\nprejudice:\nReduction of the price by 15%; and\nRealization of the Greenfield-Hydrogen-Project as planned, including a first demand\nguarantee for the performance of the obligations undertaken by Respondent in the\nvalue of 10% of the reduced price.\nPlease be aware that the Minister, Ms. Vent, will only agree to the continuation of the project if\nthe hydrogen is produced at a price which makes it competitive with other forms of energy. To\nbe competitive, we need a 15% price reduction, if not more. Any further discussion between us\nor our lawyers only makes sense if Green Hydro is willing to accept a serious price reduction of\n15% or at least a two-digit number.\nHila Cove\nHenry la Cour\nChief Executive Officer\nEquatoriana RenPower\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

Equatoriana RenPower Ltd.\n14 August 2024\nIntroduction\n1.\n2.\nIn its Request for Arbitration, Claimant summarizes the facts accurately as far as the dates are\nconcerned. Beyond that, the Request for Arbitration contains more wishful thinking than a\ncorrect legal analysis.\nThe general attitude in which Claimant approaches its own obligations under the Purchase and\nService Agreement is evidenced by its blatant breach of the confidentiality of the Parties'\nnegotiations. It is just an example of Claimant's general bad faith behavior and should in itself\nalready result in the rejection of the claims.\nFacts\n3. Following the announcement of its ambitious Green Energy Strategy, the government of\nEquatoriana took several steps to ensure the implementation of the Strategy. Inter alia, the\nplanning and permission regimes for the necessary infrastructure to ensure the energy transition\nwere streamlined and necessary funding was made available. Equatoriana RenPower, as one of\nthe government's primary vehicles to implement its Strategy, was charged with ensuring an\naccelerated development of the green hydrogen infrastructure. In that context, it planned the\nconstruction of three major facilities to produce hydrogen and asked for proposals from\ninterested producers.\n4.\nAt the time, there had been no local entity which would have been able to realize a project of\nsuch magnitude in the field of hydrogen production as the main contractor. One of the\nobjectives of the tender processes was to develop the local industry active in the field of\nrenewable energy production through high local content requirements. Respondent's main\nnegotiator, Ms. Johanna Ritter, informed the two remaining bidders with whom Respondent\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

        "text": "conducted detailed negotiations about that objective and that the amount of local content was\na decisive criterion for the final selection (Respondent Exhibit R 1).\n5. Claimant had in its bid promised a local content of at least 30% for the 100MW Plant via the\ninvolvement of Volta Transformer and Volta Electrolysers. Furthermore, Respondent's CEO\nhad informed Ms. Faraday that for the additional eAmmonia module, they were planning to use\nthe Equatorianian entity P2G as the main subcontractor, which was supposed to provide up to\n80% of the overall necessary works and services. Internally, Respondent had always planned to\nadd eAmmonia production facilities to the plant. That the additional eAmmonia module was\nstructured as an option had primarily financial and fiscal reasons. At the time of contracting,\nthe necessary funding had not yet been authorized by the ministry, so that Respondent could\nnot yet enter into a binding agreement but had to wait for an authorization in the next fiscal\nyear.\n6.\nThat is the background against which Ms. Faraday made the concessions as to the exclusion of\nthe termination rights and the inclusion of the best endeavors clause. The concessions were\nbased on the wrong assumption that Claimant's delivery would most likely contain close to 50%\nof materials and services produced in Equatoriana. That was the impression Claimant had\ncreated during the entire negotiation process, and which was maintained until the signing of the\nAgreement. On 12 July 2023, Claimant's chief negotiator for the entire project, Mr. August W.\nDeiman, sent a carefully drafted email which further reinforced the impression that there would\nmost likely be close to 50% local content (Respondent Exhibit R 2).\n7. By the time, Claimant was, however, already aware that the negotiations with P2G would most\nlikely fail. It was internally thinking about ways to formulate that in the negotiations\n(Respondent Exhibit R 3).\n8.\nAfter the conclusion of the Purchase and Service Agreement, Claimant's CEO then informed\nMs. Faraday that the final contract for the eAmmonia option had not been concluded with P2G\nbut with Green Ammonia, a company located in Danubia (Claimant Exhibit C 4).\n9. Respondent was shocked about this development but had to accept it. Upon the instruction of\nMs. Faraday, Ms. Ritter made that clear to Mr. Deiman and expressed the expectation that\nClaimant would do its best to otherwise increase the local content. Furthermore, she\nemphasized that through this development the Agreement would be under particular scrutiny\nby the critical public. In light of that, she emphasized once more the importance of strict\ncompliance with timelines and budget to keep the project out of the discussion (Respondent\nExhibit R 1).\n10. That became even more important following the changes in the government's strategy to\nalleviate the burden put on businesses in Equatoriana. Due to this change, only one of the three\ngreen hydrogen projects originally planned was going to be realized.\n11. Irrespective of that warning, Claimant immediately failed to meet the first milestone. On 1\nFebruary 2024, the final detailed plans were due. They were, however, only sent on 28 February\n2024, and when they arrived, it became clear that they were not complete. They did not include\nthe planning for the eAmmonia module. Claimant tried to explain that with problems on the\nside of its subcontractor which had not been able to deliver the plans in time.\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

Thus, its new CEO was forced to terminate the project on 29\nFebruary 2024.\n13. The correctness of the decision to terminate this project and not the other project already\ncontracted was later proven when criminal investigations were initiated against Mr. Deiman. He\nhad in the meantime become the CEO of Volta Transformer, the Equatorianian entity\nresponsible for delivering most of the local content. While Mr. Deiman was later acquitted,\nthere had been lots of negative press associated with the project, which would have made its\ncontinuation more than difficult.\nLegal Considerations\nJurisdiction and Procedure\n14. Respondent nominates as its arbitrator Mr. Carl Gustaf Synonoun, Väinämöinen Street 4,\nOceanside, Equatoriana.\n15. Respondent agrees to Claimant's proposals that the FAI shall appoint the Presiding Arbitrator\nas well as that the Arbitration Rules should be applied.\n16. The Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide the case. Compliance with the mediation\nrequirement is a condition precedent for the validity of the arbitration agreement or at least a\nrequirement for the admissibility of the claim and should guide the Arbitral Tribunal in\nexercising its procedural discretion.\n17. Claimant engaged in a blatant breach of the confidentiality of the negotiations between the\nParties. The drafting history of the Agreement leaves little doubt that the confidentiality\nobligation in Article 15 of the FAI Mediation Rules in the present case also extends to all\nnegotiations preceding the mediation. Irrespective of that inherent confidentiality obligation,\nClaimant has submitted Respondent's without-prejudice offer in clear breach of the Parties'\nagreement. To prevent Claimant from benefitting from this breach, the Arbitral Tribunal should\nexclude Exhibit C 7 from the file and ensure that its reasoning is not influenced by information\ncontained in Exhibit C 7. Furthermore, the breach should be taken into account in any cost\ndecision. This is in line with the ongoing developments in Danubia (Respondent Exhibit R 4).\nSubstance\n18. Claimant's claims are devoid of any substance, as Respondent validly terminated the Agreement\nwith its Termination Letter of 29 February 2024.\n19. Contrary to Claimant's assertion, the relationship is governed by the Civil Code of Equatoriana\nand not by the CISG. In Article 29 of the Agreement, the Parties have explicitly chosen the\n\"law of Equatoriana with the exception of its conflict of laws principles\" as the governing law\nand thereby clearly excluded the CISG. The clause is from the model contract used by\nEquatorianian state entities for all their public procurement contracts and has to be seen against\nthe background of the procurement law. While the previous model explicitly provided for the\napplication of the CISG, that was changed in the new model contract to strengthen the role of\nEquatorianian law (Respondent Exhibit R 1).\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

It\nwas concluded as part of a reverse auction in the context of a public procurement process so\nthat Article 2 lit. b CISG excludes the application of the CISG. Moreover, the contract does\nnot constitute an international sales transaction. A considerable part of the Agreement consisted\nof planning and engineering work to be done by Claimant, and most of the actual deliveries of\ngoods were made from its place of business in Equatoriana. Volta Transformer, while originally\nstill independent, was producing at the time nearly exclusively for Claimant and thus already\nconstituted a place of business of Claimant before its later formal acquisition by Claimant in\nNovember 2023.\n21. Under the Law of Equatoriana, Respondent, as a government entity, was entitled to terminate\nthe Agreement both for cause and for convenience, which it did with its Termination Letter of\n29 February 2024.\n22. Even if the CISG were applicable and the termination was invalid – which is not the case –\nClaimant would not be entitled to specific performance. While specific performance is a remedy\nforeseen in the CISG, it should not be ordered, in particular not against a government entity.\nThe Arbitral Tribunal should not interfere with the policy of a government. Furthermore,\nspecific performance should already be excluded as the central piece of evidence presented for\nits submission that there would be no interference with the policy of the government is a\ndocument which is not admissible. The without-prejudice offer made by Respondent during\nthe negotiation was protected by the confidentiality provision in the mediation rules.\nRequests for Relief\n23.

In that function, I had been in the lead for the tender process and the negotiations with the\nremaining bidders until the final decision was made. I was subsequently supervising the\nimplementation of the Agreement.\n3. From the beginning of the process, we had made clear to all bidders that for us the development\nof local capacity had been an important issue.\n4. Following the selection of the final two bidders and an initial meeting of the two CEOs, I had a\nmeeting with Claimant's main negotiator Mr. Deiman in which we discussed the further process.\nDuring that meeting, I specifically reemphasized the importance of the local content and Mr.\nDeiman told me that they were doing their best to increase the share of locally produced goods\nand services, beyond those provided by Volta Transformer. In one of the later meetings, Mr.\nDeiman informed me about their discussion with a second supplier from Equatoriana for the\noption of adding a module for the production of eAmmonia. That supplier was P2G. According\nto the internal calculation he had shown me, as correctly stated by Mr. Cavendish in his witness\nstatement, the idea was that up to 80% of the works and deliveries for the eAmmonia Option\nwould be provided by P2G. Claimant would only do the planning and engineering part, which\nwould be around 20%. According to my recollection, the highlighted parts in the internal\ncalculation contained in Mr. Cavendish's witness statement were the parts relevant for fulfilling\nthe local content requirement as to the delivery of materials.\n5. Mr. Deiman came back to me several days later with further details as to the ongoing discussions.\nI had the impression that there was a great likelihood that the contract with that supplier would\nmaterialize.\n6. Later, I learned from a friend involved in the subsequent criminal investigation against Mr.\nDeiman that already in July 2023 Claimant considered it very unlikely to conclude the contract\nwith P2G. Apparently, Claimant had received a better offer from a supplier in Danubia and had\nused its exaggerated quality concerns as a pretext to terminate the negotiations with P2G.\n7. We had decided to use as the starting point for our negotiations with all bidders the \"Model\nContract for the Purchase of Goods and Services by Equatorianian State Entities”, which we\nincluded in the documents attached to our Request for Quotation. We were aware that the Model\nmight not fit entirely, as the project could probably not be realized on the basis of a sales\ntransaction. Nevertheless, we selected the Model for political purposes. The Model Contract had\nbeen revised in 2022 by the Ministry of Justice. The revision occurred in the context of a larger\ncampaign by the ministry led by a minister from the Equatorianian National Party (ENP) \"to\nstrengthen the role of Equatorianian Law and Equatoriana as a place of dispute resolution”.\nGiven that there had been considerable opposition to green hydrogen projects from within the\nENP, we tried to avoid any potential discussion about the issue of the templates used. We were,\nhowever, aware that changes would be requested by the counterparties, and we were open to\ndiscussion.\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

That is what happened in relation to the dispute resolution clause of the Model Contract.\nClaimant was not willing to accept the foreseen arbitration clause in favor of arbitration in\nEquatoriana under the rules of the Equatorianian Arbitration Institution. Instead, it insisted on\narbitration under the rules of an institution in a third country where also the place of arbitration\nshould be. In the end, we agreed upon Claimant's suggestion on mediation and arbitration under\nthe Rules of the Finish Arbitration Institute (FAI) and included their Model Clause in our\nAgreement.\n9. In Equatoriana, there is consistent case law that in case of a multi-tier clause providing first for\nmediation and then for arbitration under the rule of an institution, the conduct of mediation is a\ncondition precedent for the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. I think I also told Mr. Deiman\nabout that jurisprudence. I am, however, not entirely certain about that. Irrespective of that, I\ndefinitively told him that we had a strong interest in an amicable settlement of disputes and\narbitration should only be the last resort to resolve disputes. That is the background to Mr.\nDeiman's explicit reference to the subsidiarity of arbitration in his email of 12 July 2023\n(Responent Exhibit R 2)\n10. Furthermore, given the political climate and the existing opposition to the new energy strategy,\nwe wanted to keep any potential dispute within the project out of the press. At the same time,\nwe did not want to press for a separate full-fledged confidentiality agreement for the resolution\nof disputes, which, if leaked, could be misinterpreted as an effort by us to hide relevant\ninformation from the public. Mr. Deiman reassured us that in case of disputes, the relevant rules\nalready provided for the necessary confidentiality. For me, it was clear that Article 15 of the\nMediation Rules should also extend to all negotiations preceding mediation.\n11. The issue of applicable law had been one of the issues on the list which Mr. Cavendish sent Ms.\nFaraday for their initial meeting after Claimant had been selected as one of the two bidders for\nfurther negotiation. The issue was, however, not really addressed at that meeting or later. At the\ninitial meeting, Mr. Cavendish merely mentioned to Ms. Faraday that in a previous transaction\ncovering the sale of stacks, his head of the legal department had told him that for international\nsales transactions, the CISG is the gold standard. As neither Mr. Cavendish nor Ms. Faraday are\nlawyers, it was agreed that the issue should be left to the lawyers for discussion. There was no\nfurther discussion on the issue. Instead, Claimant accepted the choice of law provision, which\nhad been taken directly from the 2022 version of the Model Contract. It had replaced an earlier\nversion of the Model Contract, which had explicitly provided for the application of the CISG for\nall international sales transactions. During the negotiations, Mr. Deiman told me that they had\nalready used the then Model Contract in a previous transaction with another government entity\nin 2020. As their experiences had been positive, he had no objections to using the Model Contract\nas a starting point for the negotiations. Thus, I assume that Claimant was aware of the change to\nthe choice of law clause in the 2022 version.\nOceanside, 13 August 2024\nI.

RenPower), I had\na closer look at the law of Equatoriana concerning assurances and misrepresentations.\nMy understanding was that\n•\n•\n.\naccording to the RfQ local content is a relevant consideration for being awarded the\ncontract for the green hydrogen plant at Greenfield, Equatoriana;\nin your initial offer, you had mentioned a price of EUR 300 million for the entire\n100MW plant (turnkey), of which EUR 200 million were for the electrolyser part of the\nAgreement and EUR 100 million for the EPC part;\nthe initial offer indicated that in the electrolyser part, materials and services in the\nvalue of EUR 60-80 million would come from entities from Equatoriana (parts of\nstacks/transformer and electrical equipment/packaging);\nfor the eAmmonia module (EUR 100 million) you had been in negotiation with P2G\nfrom Equatoriana, which originally looked very promising but had remaining quality\nissues, and the price now speaks in favor of another supplier (Green Ammonia), which\nwould cover 80% of the works and deliveries to be done with just 20% of planning and\nengineering done by GreenHydro; and\nyou wanted to make sure with the draft of the email attached you would neither enter\ninto a binding commitment nor could be accused of misrepresentation if the contract\nwith P2G does not materialize due to the quality concerns and the price, which is not\nunlikely.\nI have checked that under all potentially applicable regimes and think that if you tone down\nthe draft a little bit concerning the likelihood that the contract may materialize, point out the\nongoing quality issues, and state that you are confident that we may be able to overcome\nthem, you should not engage in any misrepresentation or give actionable assurances.\nPlease find my drafting suggestions in red in the attached email.\nSincerely,\nHeidi\nHead of Legal Department\nAdmitted to the Bar in Mediterraneo\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

Offers made in such\nnegotiation are regularly used and admitted\nas evidence in subsequent court or\narbitration proceedings by the other party\nto prove that the offeror was accepting part\nof the liability. As it is very difficult to\nquantify the damages resulting from such\nbehavior, there have been requests for\nlegislative actions to efficiently protect the\nconfidentiality of the negotiations. The\nproposals made range from statutory\npenalties to rules excluding such documents\nas suitable evidence in any form of binding\nlegal proceedings.\nThe second topic of legal privileges was\naddressed prominently by Santtu Osiris, the\nchief litigation counsel at Annubis,\nDanubia's largest company. In his keynote\non \"Privileged information about privileges\"\nreporting about the work of the IBA Task\nForce on this topic, he gave a recent\nexample of what he called a \"serious\ndisadvantage of the Danubian entities in\ninternational disputes\".\nSo far, Danubia has no rules on legal\nprivileges protecting such documents from\ndisclosure. The mere provision that\ncommunication between counsel and\nclients is to be kept confidential contained in\nthe ethical rules for lawyers cannot be\ncompared with the detailed rules on\nprivilege existing in other jurisdictions, such\nas the US or those jurisdictions which have\nfollowed the American approach such as\nEquatoriana. From the reports of speakers\nfrom other jurisdictions, it seems that only\nin Mediterraneo the situation is comparable\nto that in Danubia. In her first reaction to the\nrequests, the minister of justice announced\nthe formation of a working group to address\nboth issues, which also in her view required\na regulation to remedy the disadvantages of\nthe legal profession in Danubia and\nDanubian parties in disputes abroad.\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

The criminal investigation has in the\nmeantime been terminated and Mr. Deiman has been released and is cleared of all charges\n(Claimant Exhibit C 8).\nClaimant does not know how exactly the document confiscated by the prosecution authorities has\ncome into the possession of Respondent. It is, however, clear that it must have been by illicit\nmeans, either through a leak in the public prosecution office or by inducing an employee of\nClaimant to unlawfully disclose this highly confidential document.\nThe fact that Respondent nevertheless has sent it directly to the not-yet-appointed party-\nnominated arbitrators shows an attitude which completely disregards any rules of procedural\nfairness. For this reason alone, Respondent's two procedural requests should be rejected.\nAt the same time, Claimant objects to the request for the exclusion of Exhibit C 7 from the file.\nRespondent is 100% owned by the state of Equatoriana, which has not only signed the Mauritius\nConvention on Transparency but has been one of the most vociferous supporters of absolute\ntransparency in the resolution of disputes affecting public interests.

It would be contrary to good faith in the sense of Art. 7\nCISG if Respondent, as a state-owned company, could invoke confidentiality to exclude crucial\ndocuments from the arbitral proceedings.\nTo expedite the proceedings, Claimant would also like to directly address Respondent's bad faith\nchallenge to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. This submission constitutes the Claimant's\nfinal comment on the matter concerning the Arbitral Tribunal's alleged lack of jurisdiction for the\nconsideration of the Finland Arbitration Institute when making its prima facie decision on\njurisdiction (Article 15 of the FAI-Rules).\nFirst, mediation is not a condition precedent for the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal under the\nFAI Arbitration Rules. Second, Mr. la Cour's clear statement that a price reduction of 15% was a\nkind of pre-condition of any further talks made clear that without such a price reduction, which\nwas obviously not acceptable for Claimant, mediation would have been a mere waste of time.\nThus, Respondent's reliance on the mediation obligation is contrary to good faith and should be\nrejected already for that reason alone.\nSincerely yours,\nLangweiler\nJoseph Langweiler\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

I was born on 23 January 1970 and have since 1999 worked for Claimant in different functions.\nMy last position was the COO of Volta Transformer after they had been purchased by Claimant.\nBefore that, I had been the Head of Contracting at Claimant. In the latter function, I was involved\nas the main negotiator on GreenHydro's side in the conclusion of the Agreement.\n2. Following the acquisition of Volta Transformer in November 2023 by GreenHydro and my\npromotion to the COO of the latter, I have moved to Equatoriana. As the Agreement with\nGreenHydro was the most important individual contract of Volta Transformer making up 70%\nof its production capacities, I had all the information potentially relevant for the contract on my\nlaptop. That also included my personal notes and other documents in relation to the negotiations\nbetween Claimant and Respondent resulting in the conclusion of the Agreement.\n3. On 28 April 2024, i.e., before the negotiations failed, I had a discussion with Mr. la Cour in which\nhe raised serious allegations against me, Mr. Cavendish, and Ms. Faraday concerning the\nconclusion of the Agreement. He informed me that, should there be no amicable settlement, he\nwould hand over that information to the prosecution office for an investigation.\n4. I immediately reported that back to Mr. Cavendish to whom the message was objectively directed.\nHe told me not to worry and promised to contact Mr. la Cour.\n5. Two weeks later, the police raided my office, confiscated all my documents, and detained me for\ntwo days in prison, allegedly “to prevent me from interfering with their investigation”. After my\nrelease, my passport was withdrawn, and I was requested to report daily to the police.\n6. In the end, those investigations were terminated after 1 month without any result, and the\ndocuments were returned to me.\n7. Considering that experience, I decided to leave Equatoriana until the end of this arbitration. I\ncan assure you that I have never shown the document presented as Respondent's Exhibit R 3 to\nanyone from Respondent's side or their lawyers' team or have otherwise made it accessible to\nthem. I can only speculate that they received it from the investigators directly. Already in our\ndiscussions, Mr. la Cour mentioned his very close contact with the prosecution office.\n8. The only other, but less likely, option is that someone in my office had provided Respondent or\nthe state authorities with confidential and privileged information.\nCapital City, 12 August\nA. W.

Are the administrative centers of the various companies involved located at their places\nof registration? Yes.\n2. Have the Parties had any previous contractual relationships? No. Claimant, however, had\nconcluded two smaller contracts with other government entities based on the old Model\nContract. Both had been negotiated by Mr. Deiman and Mr. Law, Claimant's head of legal at\nthe time, and had not resulted in any problems. It had been in the context of the first of these\ntransactions concluded in 2020 that Mr. Law had made the statement concerning the CISG\nbeing the “Gold Standard” in international transactions to Mr. Cavendish.\n3. To what extent was the Government of Equatoriana involved in the business of\nRespondent? Respondent is a separate legal entity of private law. Its only shareholder is the\nState of Equatoriana which also appoints Respondent's management, which is then entrusted\nwith the day-to-day management, including the representation of Respondent.\n4. Does Respondent have assets in countries other than Equatoriana which would make it\npossible to enforce a potential award against Respondent in said country? Yes, there are\nassets in other countries which would most likely not benefit from immunity from execution.\n5. What portion of Volta Transformer's overall business did its relationship with Claimant\nmake up before the negotiations between Claimant and Respondent? Volta Transformer,\nin principle, had the capacity of producing two transformers of the size acquired by Claimant at\na time. Depending on existing deadlines, the workforce, and other resources are not always\nevenly allocated between the contracted transformers but one of the projects is prioritized. That\nis what happened from June 2023 onwards with the transformer that Claimant had originally\nordered for the project in Ruritania and then had planned to use for the project with\nRespondent. Furthermore, according to the contractual set-up Volta Transformer was also\nClaimant's contractual partner for the delivery of the stacks and the packaging services which\nwere to be provided by Volta Electrolyser. That is the background of Mr. Deiman's not entirely\naccurate statement in Exhibit C 8 that the Agreement with GreenHydro was the most important\nindividual contract of Volta Transformer “making up 70% of its production capacity”.\n6. Is Volta Electrolyser selling the electrolysers produced under a license of Claimant to\nthird parties? Yes, until the order for the plant project, Volta Electrolyser was nearly exclusively\nproducing for third parties and not for Claimant. The order for the contracted plant would have\nmade up 60% of the annual production capacity of Volta Electrolyser for the next year.\n7. At the time when the Respondent was contracting with the Claimant were they aware\nof the acquisition of Volta Transformers by the Claimant? Claimant did not inform\nRespondent about the offer by the Volta family before the conclusion of the Agreement.\n8. How was Volta Transformer acquired by Claimant? By a share deal. Until the acquisition\nthere were no formal or informal agreements which guaranteed Claimant any control or\noperational influence on Volta Transformer.\n9. Was the reverse auction conducted in person or online? The entire process developed in\nthree different steps of which the reverse auction itself constituted the second step which was\nconducted in person. At the first stage, all registered suppliers which intended to submit bids\nhad to do so online.

        "text": "make the various bids “comparable” despite the differences in the technologies suggested (e.g.\nPEM-Electrolysers/Alkaline-Electrolysers). For that Respondent had developed a complex\nformular weighing inter alia the technologies used, the efficiency of the plant and other factors\nto arrive at the (calculated) price. The formular and the (calculated) price of its bid was\ncommunicated to each bidder. The reverse auction, as the second step, was then conducted on\nthe basis of these formulas and the resulting calculated prices. With the final two bidders\nRespondent then conducted individual negotiations.\n10. What was the wording of the choice of law clause of the former Model Contract of the\nEquatorianian government? “The Agreement is governed by the CISG. For all issues not\nregulated by the CISG the law of Equatoriana shall apply\". The official press release made in\nrelation to the amended Model Contract in 2022 explicitly mentioned that changes were made\nto the forum selection clause and the choice of law clause “to strengthen the role of\nEquatorianian Law and Equatoriana as a place of dispute resolution\".\n11. What was the background for including the issue of the applicable law on the list of\nissues to be discussed by Mr. Cavendish with Ms. Faraday? The list had been prepared by\nClaimant's head of legal at the time, Mr. Law, after he had taken a look at the Model Contract\nand the changes made to the old Model Contract which had been the basis of a previous\ntransaction with another government entity. Originally, a meeting between Mr. Law and Mr.\nCavendish had been planned for the day before the first meeting with Ms. Faraday in which the\ndifferent items on the list were to be discussed. Furthermore, it was planned that Mr. Law would\nsupport the negotiations from the legal side as he was the only lawyer in the five lawyers of the\nlegal department that specialized in international contracts. The other lawyers dealt with labor\nlaw and regulatory questions. On the day before the meeting, it was discovered that Mr. Law\nhad leaked important information to one of Claimant's competitors, which led to the immediate\ntermination of his contract and the start of a criminal investigation against him. Thus, the reason\nfor the inclusion was never revealed to Mr. Cavendish. The following negotiations were\nconducted by Mr. Deiman with the support of Ms. Smith, one of the labor lawyers who then\nbecame the new head of the legal department. As Ms. Smith had interpreted the choice of law\nclause in the Model Contract to refer to the non-harmonized law of Equatoriana, she had\nconducted her examination referred to in Exhibit R 3 primarily on the basis of the non-\nharmonized law of Equatoriana. In addition, her legal intern - a former Vis Mootie - had also\nprovided an evaluation on the basis of the CISG, which is the reason for her statement that she\nhad “checked that under all potentially applicable regimes\".\n12. Is there any usage or practice concerning the enforceability of mediation clause, or did\nthe Parties discuss during negotiations of the Purchase and Service Agreement, that\nmediation was to occur within a specified time period? No.\n13. Was there any discussion about the mediation clause and its deviation from the model\nclause? No. Respondent accepted the draft of the clause submitted by Claimant without\nchecking whether it deviated from the FAI-model clause.\n14. Did the Respondent ever request mediation or indicate that it would be inclined to\nparticipate in mediation as it applies to these issues? No. There was no specific request\nafter the dispute had arisen and before the RfA had been submitted.\n15. Did Respondent make any payments to Claimant? Yes. Respondent paid the 10% due on\n1 October 2023 but not the 25% due on 10 February 2024 as Claimant had not submitted the\nFinal Plans on 1 February 2024. Respondent has complained about the non-delivery, stating\nthat it would not make any further payment until the Final Plans were delivered for which it set\na deadline until the end of the month. Respondent reserved any further rights.\n16. Were the components produced by Volta Transformer/Electrolyzer to be delivered\ndirectly to the construction site? Yes. As the transformer and the stacks were produced in\nEquatoriana, it was planned to have them delivered directly to the site where they were to be\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

The connection of the\ntransformer the stacks and the various other elements of the core system was to occur in a way\nwhich allowed their easy removal in case of maintenance or replacement.\n17. Under the EPC-work Section of the table, do the headings \"Compressor, pipes, cable\ninstallation, connections, and other equipment” refer to the supply of goods? Yes. The\nhighlighted parts for the EPC-Work and the electrolyser are to be treated as a delivery of goods.\n18. Are the two extension options finalized to the extent that the Purchase and Service\nAgreement already includes the final purchase price as well as a timeframe? Yes. For the\ncase that Respondent intended to exercise the options in full, price, timeframe, and all further\ndetails were agreed and no further contract needed to be concluded. That was also the\nbackground for including clause 4 into the RfQ. Respondent, however, also had the option to\nexercise the extension options only in part. For that case, the Agreement provided for a\nproportional reduction of the price and the addition of a further handling fee to compensate\nClaimant for the additional costs resulting from the reduced scope.\n19. Did the local content requirement (“at least 25%\") concern just the electrolyser (i.e., the\nmain plant) or were the option(s) a part of it? It extended to the options as well. Claimant\nwould have met the requirement even if only the eAmmonia option had been exercised and\nGreen Ammonia had done the work.\n20. Does Green Ammonia source any of its material from Equatoriana? No.\n21. Would the delay in delivery of the final plans for the eAmmonia option have had any\neffect on the delivery date of the turnkey plant? Most likely not. The delay was entirely due\nto problems on the side of Green Ammonia where the entire planning team had left the\ncompany in December. Claimant had expected the plans for the eAmmonia option in the first\nweek of January to include them in its Final Plans. As Respondent had informed Claimant that\nthe exercise of the eAmmonia-option was very likely, Claimant wanted to take into account the\nplans for the eAmmonia extension in its planning of the already contract plant, hoping to\nsubsequently save up to EUR 1 million for a subsequent construction of eAmmonia extension.\nIn the beginning, Green Ammonia had promised Claimant to deliver the planning by the end of\nJanuary but then did not deliver anything until the end of March. Claimant communicated the\nreasons for not submitting the Final Planning to Respondent on 1 February 2024 when the plan\nwas due. It also started to finalize the plans for the plant without taking into account the\neAmmonia option. It intended to recover the additional costs resulting for the lack of\ncoordination or the planning from Green Ammonia, in case the eAmmonia-option was\nexercised.\n22. Is there an urgency for Claimant to complete the project by the agreed timeline in the\nAgreement of 2026? Claimant had a very strong interest in having the plant operate as soon as\npossible to have a reference project available for the expected increase in orders for green\nhydrogen plants from 2026 onwards.\n23. What was the extent of the Parties' negotiations between the issuance of termination\nletter and the without-prejudice offer? With the letter of 12 March, Claimant had rejected\nRespondent's termination as non-justified and pointed out that the belated delivery of the Final\nPlans would most likely not result in any delays concerning the final handover of the plant.\nFurthermore, Claimant requested payment of at least 50% of the amount due on 10 February\n2024 and the issuance of the final permits as agreed, or a discussion about dates should that not\nbe possible. By the letter of 24 March, Respondent rejected those requests, confirmed the\ntermination, and announced that no further payments would be made. Claimant reacted with a\nletter dated 4 April, prepared by its lawyers, rejecting once more the termination and outlining\nthe legal situation and potential claims by Claimant suggesting a meeting at C-management level.\nThe meeting had been planned for 28 April in Equatoriana. Due to a car accident on 27 April\nwhich left him hospitalized, Mr. Cavendish had to cancel the meeting which led to the discussion\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

The meeting between Mr. Cavendish and Mr. la\nCour took place on 12 May, lasted only 30 minutes, and had the content reported by Mr.\nCavendish in his witness statement.\n24. How did Claimant respond to the without-prejudice offer? Claimant rejected that offer on\nthe next day and threatened to initiate arbitration proceedings should Respondent not engage\nin further discussion without any preconditions. There was no further response from\nRespondent to that letter.\n25. What happened to the other hydrogen projects that were reviewed by Equatoriana\nRenPower? For one of the projects, the final contract was yet to be signed when the change of\ngovernment occurred. The negotiation was terminated, and no contract was ever signed. The\nsecond project, which involved a 50 MW plant based on an alkaline electrolyzation process, was\nsuccessfully renegotiated between the Parties and a new agreement providing, inter alia, a price\nreduction of 7 % was finally signed on 1 October 2024.\n26.

Is Article 7.3.8 of the Equatorianian Civil Code, containing the right of governmental\nentities to terminate contracts for convenience under certain conditions, mandatory?\nThere are diverging views on that with a slight majority considering it to be not mandatory. It\nis, however, largely accepted that the provision does not form part of the ordre public of\nEquatoriana.\n34. Can you provide some additional information about the legal system in Equatoriana?\nEquatoriana is a common law country and a dualistic state. It has ratified the Mauritius\nConvention and has adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Mediation, as has Danubia.

        "text": "The data outlines the investment distribution for two key categories: Electrolyser and EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) work, with allocations divided between two projects, Green Hydrogen (Mediterraneo) and Volta Transformer (Equatoriana). \n\nFor the electrolyser category, the total investment amounts to €200 million, which is distributed as follows: The core system receives €100 million, accounting for 50% of the total investment, with €60 million (60%) allocated to Green Hydrogen and €40 million (40%) to Volta Transformer. Trafo and electrical equipment represents €40 million (20%), entirely allocated to Volta Transformer (40%) while Green Hydrogen receives none. Packaging accounts for €20 million (10%), fully assigned to Volta Transformer (20%) with no investment for Green Hydrogen. Project management and engineering, along with site works, each account for €15 million (7.5%). Both categories have €15 million (15%) allocated to Green Hydrogen but receive no investment for Volta Transformer. Training and maintenance is budgeted at €10 million (5%), with €10 million (10%) for Green Hydrogen and none for Volta Transformer. The subtotal investment for electrolyser across both projects is distributed evenly: €100 million (100%) each for Green Hydrogen and Volta Transformer.\n\nFor the EPC work, the total investment reaches €100 million, allocated as follows: Compressor, pipes, cable installation, connections, and other equipment constitute €50 million (50%) with €50 million (50%) for Green Hydrogen and none for Volta Transformer. Buildings and foundations for the facility take €25 million (25%), equally split at €25 million (25%) for Green Hydrogen and no contribution for Volta Transformer. The remaining EPC services for constructing the turnkey facility also represent €25 million (25%), split identically with €25 million (25%) for Green Hydrogen and no investment for Volta Transformer. The subtotal investment under EPC work is entirely apportioned to Green Hydrogen (€100 million, 100%), with no funds directed to Volta Transformer.",
