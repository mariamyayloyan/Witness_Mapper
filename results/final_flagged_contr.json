        "doc_text": "In the presence of James Positive,\nEquatoriana's Minister for Energy and\nEnvironment, Equatoriana RenPower (ERP)\nand Green Hydrogen yesterday signed an\nagreement for the construction of one of\nthe most advanced green hydrogen plants\nwith an original capacity of 100 MW, but the\npossibility to increase the output at a later\ntime up to double the amount. According to\nMs. Faraday, the Agreement has the\npotential to be a quantum leap in the\nproduction of green hydrogen ensuring\nEquatoriana's position as one of the leading\nnations in the production of green energy.\nThe Agreement was the result of a\ncontroversial tender process which started\nin January 2023. With the publication of the\nGreen Energy Strategy there has been, what\ncritics have called, a \"hydro-hype”. The\nnumber of start-ups in the fields has\nmultiplied as has the investment. Still there\nis, however, no production of green\nhydrogen on a large-scale basis, in particular\nnot on the basis of PEM-electrolysis, used by\nGreen Hydrogen. While it is generally\nacknowledged that PEM-electrolysis is\nconceptually more suitable for the use of an\nunsteady supply of energy resulting from\nrenewables, its proponents have yet to\nprove the commercial viability of the\ntechnique. It is considerably more expensive\nthan the traditional alkaline electrolysis and\nit has not yet been shown that the higher\ncosts are compensated by the higher\nefficiency. Green Hydrogen's CEO Mr.\nCavendish told journalists that he was happy\nto finally prove to critics that their concerns\nlacked any basis. In his view, Equatoriana\nRenPower was the perfect partner to show\nthat the technique could not only be\noperated at small scale but also in large\nplants of 100 MW or more. With the strong\ngovernment support and the advanced\nstage of planning, he considered the plan to\nhave the plant operating from 2026\nambitious but realistic.\nWhile for most other bidders the long lead\ntimes for transformers made the deadline\nunrealistic, Green Hydrogen had apparently\nguaranteed during the negotiations to have\nCLAIMANT EXHIBIT C 3\na transformer of the correct size available\nfrom the beginning of 2024. It is very likely\nthat this is the transformer which had\noriginally been ordered from Volta\nTransformer for the abandoned project in\nRuritania. Volta Transformer, a world\nmarket leader in the area of large\ntransformers based in Equatoriana and\nbelonging to the Volta family refused to\ncomment on that.\nNot everyone is convinced about the\ndecision of ERP. The criticism is coming\nfrom different angles and circles. Some\nquestion whether energy production with\ngreen hydrogen is really efficient. Others\nquestioned the decision to supplement the\nplant with production facilities for e-\nAmmonia. In their view facilities for the\nproduction of e-fuels would have been\nneeded more urgently.\nInformed circles report that a crucial\nelement for awarding the project to Green\nHydrogen was the amount of parts\nproduced locally in Equatoriana. Apparently\nGreen Hydrogen is in advanced talks with\ntwo local companies. They would supply of\nclose to 50% of the parts and services\nneeded to fulfill the contract in the likely\nevent that ERP realizes the e-Ammonia\noption. It seems, that Green Hydrogen's\nprimary expertise lies in the field of\nhydrogen production while it has to rely on\noutside know-how for the production of e-\nAmmonia.\nIt can be assumed that the Agreement had\nthe political backing of Mr. Positive. Thus,\nthe minister, as usual goes all in. It is unlikely\nthat he would politically survive a failure of\nthe project. After some controversial\nlegislative projects and the massive\ncampaign started by the opposition and\nparts of the ENP against his politics his\nsupport rates are at an all time low. That\nmakes him the premier candidate for any\ngovernment restructuring.\nIt remains to be seen whether the project\ndevelops into the great success predicted\nby its proponents or is actually the\nboondoggle foreseen by the critics.\nTRANSITION NEWS\n18 July 2023\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

Others\nquestioned the decision to supplement the\nplant with production facilities for e-\nAmmonia. In their view facilities for the\nproduction of e-fuels would have been\nneeded more urgently.\nInformed circles report that a crucial\nelement for awarding the project to Green\nHydrogen was the amount of parts\nproduced locally in Equatoriana. Apparently\nGreen Hydrogen is in advanced talks with\ntwo local companies. They would supply of\nclose to 50% of the parts and services\nneeded to fulfill the contract in the likely\nevent that ERP realizes the e-Ammonia\noption. It seems, that Green Hydrogen's\nprimary expertise lies in the field of\nhydrogen production while it has to rely on\noutside know-how for the production of e-\nAmmonia.\nIt can be assumed that the Agreement had\nthe political backing of Mr. Positive. Thus,\nthe minister, as usual goes all in. It is unlikely\nthat he would politically survive a failure of\nthe project. After some controversial\nlegislative projects and the massive\ncampaign started by the opposition and\nparts of the ENP against his politics his\nsupport rates are at an all time low. That\nmakes him the premier candidate for any\ngovernment restructuring.\nIt remains to be seen whether the project\ndevelops into the great success predicted\nby its proponents or is actually the\nboondoggle foreseen by the critics.\nTRANSITION NEWS\n18 July 2023\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

        "doc_text": "2. Respondent, Equatoriana RenPower Ltd. (ERenPow) is a fully government-owned company.\n3.\nIt was created in 2004 by a merger of the two state-owned energy companies operating in the\nfield of renewables. In addition to being a major player in the Equatorianian market with its\nwind and solar farms, ERenPow plays an important role in the “Green Energy Strategy” of the\nGovernment of Equatoriana. To ensure the ambitious goal of Net-Zero-2040, ERenPow was\nto invest in the creation of a “sustainable hydrogen infrastructure covering the entire value chain\nneeded to decarbonize Equatoriana's large steel and transport industry”, as was stated in the\nGreen Energy Strategy. On 3 January 2023, ERenPow invited bids for the construction and\ndelivery of a plant to produce green hydrogen and potential derivatives.\nThe relevant documents were published via the official tender platform. They provided that the\ntender process as such was governed by the Public Procurement Law of Equatoriana and be\nconducted in its initial phase as a reverse auction. It was a technology open tender, and for the\ncomparability of the various proposals, the overall efficiency in relation to the price was\nrelevant. The Request for Quotation further stated that the local content of the materials to be\nprovided was an important factor in evaluating the bids and to be eligible a minimum of 25%\nwas required. (Claimant Exhibit C 1).\n4. According to the description, the bids were to cover the following four elements: a fixed 100\nMW plant for the production of green hydrogen (turnkey), maintenance and training services\nfor one year, and two options for Respondent concerning the extension of the plant. The first\ncovered a mere extension in capacity up to double the fixed contracted capacity. The second\ncovered the addition of a part for the production of eAmmonia.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\nFor Claimant, the realisation of the project was of considerable importance. It would have been\nthe first opportunity for Claimant to showcase its new technology on a larger scale and show\nthe advantages of its patent-protected production process. The process allows for the use of\nthe excess heat created during the production of hydrogen for district heating, thereby\nincreasing the overall efficiency of the plant. So far, the only operating plant is Claimant's own\n5 MW facility and at the time of the tender, another 20 MW plant had just been commissioned\nby the Government of Mediterraneo. Claimant's innovative process is based on electrolysis\nusing a proton exchange membrane (PEM-electrolysis). It relies on the special properties of the\nused membrane, which is permeable to protons but not to gases such as hydrogen or oxygen.\nThe relevant electrolysers are delivered in stacks of 10 MW each. The modular setup has the\nadvantage that further stacks may be added at a later time, provided that the required other\ninfrastructure and space is available.\nThe PEM-electrolysis is particularly suitable for the use of unstable renewable power, and the\noverall plant efficiency in Claimant's research facility was over 85% due to the additional use of\nthe process heat.\nThe great attraction of the project was the likelihood that it could be realized within a very short\ntime. There was strong Equatorianian government support, and many preparatory steps in the\nplanning and permission process had already been taken. Under the Green Energy Strategy, the\nnecessary environmental, construction, and operation permits for green energy projects were\nto be granted in a facilitated and expedited procedure, which included strict timelines and a\nlimitation of the possible objections. For the project itself, those parts of the planning process\ninvolving the participation of the local communities had already been completed, excluding the\nrisk of any delay from that side. The issuance of the necessary environmental permits was\nimminent and only depended on internal procedures. For the other permits, which usually do\nnot create any problems, the detailed planning of the plant was necessary. Furthermore, the\nconstruction site was prepared and well-connected with the required infrastructure.\nIn addition, a suitable transformer was available. In 2020, Claimant ordered the transformer\nfrom its long-time Equatorianian business partner Volta Transformer for another project. The\ntransformer was to be delivered in early 2024, but in November 2022 the other project had\nbeen cancelled due to the insolvency of the other customer. The transformer was of the right\nsize for the present project with a capacity able to cover also the two options, should\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

On the basis of the calculation\nat the time, the offer would not only have failed to cover the costs but also resulted in a loss of\nEUR 15 million already for the fixed part if no further savings could be realized. Respondent\nwas aware of that, as Claimant was very transparent about its cost calculation during the\nnegotiations. The realization of that innovative project required ongoing and forward-looking\ncooperation between the two partners who trust each other. Claimant also informed\nRespondent about its ongoing negotiations with the two local partners and the possibility that,\nif successful, Claimant would have a local content of much more than the required 25%.\n14. After two and a half months of intensive negotiations, Claimant finally managed to sign the\nPurchase and Service Agreement with Respondent on 17 July 2023. Deviating slightly from the\noriginally planned structure, the Agreement provided in essence that Claimant would deliver at\na first stage a plant of 100 MW at a price of EUR 285 million and would grant Respondent two\noptions for the extension of the plant in capacity and products (Claimant Exhibit C 2).\n15. As agreed, there was considerable media coverage about the project and the signing of the\ncontract. The media emphasized the innovative character of the technology used (Claimant\nExhibit C 3). Unfortunately, someone also leaked incorrect information about Claimant's\nadherence to the local content requirement, which seriously affected its ongoing negotiation\nwith the local partner P2G for the eAmmonia module, reinforcing unrealistic price\nexpectations.\n16. In the end, the negotiations with P2G failed due to quality issues, and Claimant had to contract\nGreen Ammonia from Danubia as its partner for the eAmmonia module. This had no influence\non the local content for the contracted 100 MW green hydrogen plant which was still above the\nrequested 25% but would have resulted in a lower percentage if Respondent exercised the\neAmmonia option. Claimant immediately informed Respondent that its plan to contract P2G\nfor the eAmmonia module had not worked (Claimant Exhibit C 4).\n17. In October 2023, local elections in Equatoriana led to a shift in the power balance within the\nEquatorianian government. As a consequence, Mr. Positive, the particularly unpopular minister\nfor energy and environment, was replaced by a colleague from the Equatoriana National Party\n(ENP), Ms. Theresa Vent. The ENP and Ms. Vent had long opposed the Green Energy Strategy\ndeveloped by the previous minister. In their view, it was too strict and too focused on specific\nquotas for certain types of renewables, in particular green hydrogen.\n18. In her first press conference, Ms. Vent announced a revision of the Green Energy Strategy and\na major reshuffle in the board of directors of ERenPow. On 27 December 2023, Claimant's\nCEO, Mr. Cavendish, received a call from his then counterpart at ERenPow, Ms. Michelle\nFaraday. Ms. Faraday informed Mr. Cavendish that she would be replaced by the end of the\nmonth by a former manager of a solar company, Mr. Henry la Cour. He was a member of the\nENP and a well-known critic of hydro energy. She confirmed rumours that ERenPow would\nreview all contracts to see whether they fit the new policy objectives (Claimant Exhibit C 5).\nHer prediction was that the new CEO would try everything to either terminate the unwanted\ncontracts or at least aggressively renegotiate them.\n19. That is what happened shortly thereafter. On 29 February 2024, Respondent gave notice of\ntermination of the Purchase and Service Agreement due to a delay of 28 days in delivering the\nfinal plans for the entire plant including the options (Claimant Exhibit C 6). Mr. la Cour further\npointed to a provision in the law of Equatoriana according to which state entities could always\nterminate contracts for convenience against the payment of expenses incurred if government\npolicies changed. In the ensuing negotiations, Respondent took the position that the Agreement\nallegedly no longer fitted the amended policy and thus had to be terminated.\n20. Claimant strongly contested that view, and Mr. Cavendish left no doubt that in its view\nRespondent had no right to terminate the Agreement. In light of Claimant's interest in the\nrealisation of the project as a reference project, any right to terminate for convenience had been\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

Furthermore, Respondent's CEO\nhad informed Ms. Faraday that for the additional eAmmonia module, they were planning to use\nthe Equatorianian entity P2G as the main subcontractor, which was supposed to provide up to\n80% of the overall necessary works and services. Internally, Respondent had always planned to\nadd eAmmonia production facilities to the plant. That the additional eAmmonia module was\nstructured as an option had primarily financial and fiscal reasons. At the time of contracting,\nthe necessary funding had not yet been authorized by the ministry, so that Respondent could\nnot yet enter into a binding agreement but had to wait for an authorization in the next fiscal\nyear.\n6.\nThat is the background against which Ms. Faraday made the concessions as to the exclusion of\nthe termination rights and the inclusion of the best endeavors clause. The concessions were\nbased on the wrong assumption that Claimant's delivery would most likely contain close to 50%\nof materials and services produced in Equatoriana. That was the impression Claimant had\ncreated during the entire negotiation process, and which was maintained until the signing of the\nAgreement. On 12 July 2023, Claimant's chief negotiator for the entire project, Mr. August W.\nDeiman, sent a carefully drafted email which further reinforced the impression that there would\nmost likely be close to 50% local content (Respondent Exhibit R 2).\n7.

As you are\naware, it is a crucial document for Equatoriana RenPower's further planning.\nPursuant to Article 7.3.1 of the Equatorianian Civil Code, we are entitled to terminate the contract\nwith immediate effects in cases of a fundamental breach of contract. Your belated delivery of the\ndetailed plans for the plant, 28 days after the agreed milestone on 1 February 2024, and still lacking\nplans for the eAmmonia module, constitutes such a breach and raises serious concerns about your\nability to perform the Agreement as contractually agreed.\nIn addition, as a governmental entity, Equatoriana RenPower is entitled to terminate any of its\ncontracts for convenience if it conflicts with the policies of the government. As you are probably\naware from the public discussion, there have been serious concerns about the negative effects of\nthe Green Energy Strategy on the competitiveness of Equatorianian businesses due to the high\ncosts of energy. That has led to a revision of the strategy which no longer focuses on the\nexpensive generation of energy using hydrogen but more on other less expensive sources of\nenergy. Consequently, the contract concluded with you no longer fits into Equatoriana's energy\nstrategy.\nCould I ask you to confirm receipt of this letter and inform us about your availability to discuss\nthe legal consequences and the details of the termination? In the meantime, we will evaluate the\ndamages resulting from your breach of contract and the ensuing termination and present you with\na corresponding damage claim.\nYours sincerely,\nHila Cove\nHenry la Cour, CEO\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

Claimant also informed\nRespondent about its ongoing negotiations with the two local partners and the possibility that,\nif successful, Claimant would have a local content of much more than the required 25%.\n14. After two and a half months of intensive negotiations, Claimant finally managed to sign the\nPurchase and Service Agreement with Respondent on 17 July 2023. Deviating slightly from the\noriginally planned structure, the Agreement provided in essence that Claimant would deliver at\na first stage a plant of 100 MW at a price of EUR 285 million and would grant Respondent two\noptions for the extension of the plant in capacity and products (Claimant Exhibit C 2).\n15. As agreed, there was considerable media coverage about the project and the signing of the\ncontract. The media emphasized the innovative character of the technology used (Claimant\nExhibit C 3). Unfortunately, someone also leaked incorrect information about Claimant's\nadherence to the local content requirement, which seriously affected its ongoing negotiation\nwith the local partner P2G for the eAmmonia module, reinforcing unrealistic price\nexpectations.\n16.

This had no influence\non the local content for the contracted 100 MW green hydrogen plant which was still above the\nrequested 25% but would have resulted in a lower percentage if Respondent exercised the\neAmmonia option. Claimant immediately informed Respondent that its plan to contract P2G\nfor the eAmmonia module had not worked (Claimant Exhibit C 4).\n17. In October 2023, local elections in Equatoriana led to a shift in the power balance within the\nEquatorianian government. As a consequence, Mr. Positive, the particularly unpopular minister\nfor energy and environment, was replaced by a colleague from the Equatoriana National Party\n(ENP), Ms. Theresa Vent. The ENP and Ms. Vent had long opposed the Green Energy Strategy\ndeveloped by the previous minister. In their view, it was too strict and too focused on specific\nquotas for certain types of renewables, in particular green hydrogen.\n18. In her first press conference, Ms. Vent announced a revision of the Green Energy Strategy and\na major reshuffle in the board of directors of ERenPow. On 27 December 2023, Claimant's\nCEO, Mr. Cavendish, received a call from his then counterpart at ERenPow, Ms. Michelle\nFaraday. Ms. Faraday informed Mr. Cavendish that she would be replaced by the end of the\nmonth by a former manager of a solar company, Mr. Henry la Cour. He was a member of the\nENP and a well-known critic of hydro energy. She confirmed rumours that ERenPow would\nreview all contracts to see whether they fit the new policy objectives (Claimant Exhibit C 5).\nHer prediction was that the new CEO would try everything to either terminate the unwanted\ncontracts or at least aggressively renegotiate them.\n19. That is what happened shortly thereafter. On 29 February 2024, Respondent gave notice of\ntermination of the Purchase and Service Agreement due to a delay of 28 days in delivering the\nfinal plans for the entire plant including the options (Claimant Exhibit C 6). Mr. la Cour further\npointed to a provision in the law of Equatoriana according to which state entities could always\nterminate contracts for convenience against the payment of expenses incurred if government\npolicies changed. In the ensuing negotiations, Respondent took the position that the Agreement\nallegedly no longer fitted the amended policy and thus had to be terminated.\n20. Claimant strongly contested that view, and Mr. Cavendish left no doubt that in its view\nRespondent had no right to terminate the Agreement. In light of Claimant's interest in the\nrealisation of the project as a reference project, any right to terminate for convenience had been\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

        "doc_text": "2. Respondent, Equatoriana RenPower Ltd. (ERenPow) is a fully government-owned company.\n3.\nIt was created in 2004 by a merger of the two state-owned energy companies operating in the\nfield of renewables. In addition to being a major player in the Equatorianian market with its\nwind and solar farms, ERenPow plays an important role in the “Green Energy Strategy” of the\nGovernment of Equatoriana. To ensure the ambitious goal of Net-Zero-2040, ERenPow was\nto invest in the creation of a “sustainable hydrogen infrastructure covering the entire value chain\nneeded to decarbonize Equatoriana's large steel and transport industry”, as was stated in the\nGreen Energy Strategy. On 3 January 2023, ERenPow invited bids for the construction and\ndelivery of a plant to produce green hydrogen and potential derivatives.\nThe relevant documents were published via the official tender platform. They provided that the\ntender process as such was governed by the Public Procurement Law of Equatoriana and be\nconducted in its initial phase as a reverse auction. It was a technology open tender, and for the\ncomparability of the various proposals, the overall efficiency in relation to the price was\nrelevant. The Request for Quotation further stated that the local content of the materials to be\nprovided was an important factor in evaluating the bids and to be eligible a minimum of 25%\nwas required. (Claimant Exhibit C 1).\n4. According to the description, the bids were to cover the following four elements: a fixed 100\nMW plant for the production of green hydrogen (turnkey), maintenance and training services\nfor one year, and two options for Respondent concerning the extension of the plant. The first\ncovered a mere extension in capacity up to double the fixed contracted capacity. The second\ncovered the addition of a part for the production of eAmmonia.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\nFor Claimant, the realisation of the project was of considerable importance. It would have been\nthe first opportunity for Claimant to showcase its new technology on a larger scale and show\nthe advantages of its patent-protected production process. The process allows for the use of\nthe excess heat created during the production of hydrogen for district heating, thereby\nincreasing the overall efficiency of the plant. So far, the only operating plant is Claimant's own\n5 MW facility and at the time of the tender, another 20 MW plant had just been commissioned\nby the Government of Mediterraneo. Claimant's innovative process is based on electrolysis\nusing a proton exchange membrane (PEM-electrolysis). It relies on the special properties of the\nused membrane, which is permeable to protons but not to gases such as hydrogen or oxygen.\nThe relevant electrolysers are delivered in stacks of 10 MW each. The modular setup has the\nadvantage that further stacks may be added at a later time, provided that the required other\ninfrastructure and space is available.\nThe PEM-electrolysis is particularly suitable for the use of unstable renewable power, and the\noverall plant efficiency in Claimant's research facility was over 85% due to the additional use of\nthe process heat.\nThe great attraction of the project was the likelihood that it could be realized within a very short\ntime. There was strong Equatorianian government support, and many preparatory steps in the\nplanning and permission process had already been taken. Under the Green Energy Strategy, the\nnecessary environmental, construction, and operation permits for green energy projects were\nto be granted in a facilitated and expedited procedure, which included strict timelines and a\nlimitation of the possible objections. For the project itself, those parts of the planning process\ninvolving the participation of the local communities had already been completed, excluding the\nrisk of any delay from that side. The issuance of the necessary environmental permits was\nimminent and only depended on internal procedures. For the other permits, which usually do\nnot create any problems, the detailed planning of the plant was necessary. Furthermore, the\nconstruction site was prepared and well-connected with the required infrastructure.\nIn addition, a suitable transformer was available. In 2020, Claimant ordered the transformer\nfrom its long-time Equatorianian business partner Volta Transformer for another project. The\ntransformer was to be delivered in early 2024, but in November 2022 the other project had\nbeen cancelled due to the insolvency of the other customer. The transformer was of the right\nsize for the present project with a capacity able to cover also the two options, should\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.

Claimant had in its bid promised a local content of at least 30% for the 100MW Plant via the\ninvolvement of Volta Transformer and Volta Electrolysers. Furthermore, Respondent's CEO\nhad informed Ms. Faraday that for the additional eAmmonia module, they were planning to use\nthe Equatorianian entity P2G as the main subcontractor, which was supposed to provide up to\n80% of the overall necessary works and services. Internally, Respondent had always planned to\nadd eAmmonia production facilities to the plant. That the additional eAmmonia module was\nstructured as an option had primarily financial and fiscal reasons. At the time of contracting,\nthe necessary funding had not yet been authorized by the ministry, so that Respondent could\nnot yet enter into a binding agreement but had to wait for an authorization in the next fiscal\nyear.\n6.\nThat is the background against which Ms. Faraday made the concessions as to the exclusion of\nthe termination rights and the inclusion of the best endeavors clause. The concessions were\nbased on the wrong assumption that Claimant's delivery would most likely contain close to 50%\nof materials and services produced in Equatoriana. That was the impression Claimant had\ncreated during the entire negotiation process, and which was maintained until the signing of the\nAgreement. On 12 July 2023, Claimant's chief negotiator for the entire project, Mr. August W.\nDeiman, sent a carefully drafted email which further reinforced the impression that there would\nmost likely be close to 50% local content (Respondent Exhibit R 2).\n7. By the time, Claimant was, however, already aware that the negotiations with P2G would most\nlikely fail. It was internally thinking about ways to formulate that in the negotiations\n(Respondent Exhibit R 3).\n8.\nAfter the conclusion of the Purchase and Service Agreement, Claimant's CEO then informed\nMs. Faraday that the final contract for the eAmmonia option had not been concluded with P2G\nbut with Green Ammonia, a company located in Danubia (Claimant Exhibit C 4).\n9. Respondent was shocked about this development but had to accept it. Upon the instruction of\nMs. Faraday, Ms. Ritter made that clear to Mr. Deiman and expressed the expectation that\nClaimant would do its best to otherwise increase the local content. Furthermore, she\nemphasized that through this development the Agreement would be under particular scrutiny\nby the critical public. In light of that, she emphasized once more the importance of strict\ncompliance with timelines and budget to keep the project out of the discussion (Respondent\nExhibit R 1).\n10.

I would like to keep you updated on our negotiations with Volta\nTransformer and with P2G.\nThe contract with Volta Transformer was finally signed yesterday with the content which had\nformed the basis for the guaranteed part of local content in our Agreement. Consequently, Volta\nTransformer, either directly or through its subsidiary Volta Electrolysers, will provide 40% of the\nelectrolyser stacks, the transformer and related electronic equipment, as well as perform the\npacking of all stacks at the Greenfield site in Equatoriana.\nUnfortunately, the negotiations with P2G for their contribution to the optional eAmmonia module\nfailed in the end. Our visits to their production site raised doubts that P2G would be able to\nprovide the contracted services and work products within the time agreed. We are also concerned\nthat their eAmmonia production installation would not meet our quality standards and thus would\nnot fit well into our plant. We have scrutinized their production process, as well as their workforce\nfor the last three weeks, and realized that it is doubtful that they can guarantee the quality and\nefficiency required.\nThe good news is, however, that Green Ammonia, the second company we were investigating as a\npotential supplier, complied with the quality requirements. They have also sufficient capacity to\ndeliver the required products and services within a short period of time. At present their sole\nproduction facility is based in Danubia. Should our orders increase in the future, they will have to\nbuild a second production facility. In that case, the most natural place for them would be\nEquatoriana, where they would then have a reference project.\nIrrespective of whether the option is finally exercised, we easily meet the local content requirement\nconcerning the material to be provided. Even if you look at both parts of the Agreement, i.e., the\nElectrolyser-part and the EPC-part, for the firmly contracted capacity of 100 MW, the material\nproduced and delivered by Volta Transformer makes up more than 30% of it. If you are just looking\nat the materials physically delivered, i.e., leaving out the planning, engineering, and construction\nwork provided by us, the products delivered by Volta Transformer amount to more than 40% of\nthe products delivered.\nI will keep you updated on all further developments.\nKind regards,\nPoul\nCEO\nGreenHydro plc\n1974 Russell Avenue, Capital City\nMediterraneo\nT: (0)146 9346355\nEmail: p.cavendish@greenhydro.me\nVIENNA\n© Association for the Organisation and Promotion of the Willem C.
